# AvrTemplate
This is a basic template for AVR projects

The Arduino nano will be the main target because it is cheap and usable on breadboards.

## Toolchain

### For Linux:
Just use the default avr-gcc toolchain

use *make install* to install the build tools

### For Windows
The Compiler from the Arduino zip file works perfectly.
Use the make.exe from cygwin64 package
Add both to the Windows Path this should be all to get it building.
